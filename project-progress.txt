RECENT SESSION CONVERSATION HISTORY & DECISIONS
==============================================
📅 Session Context: User started meeting with Emily Johnson (direct report)
🎯 Main Request: "i want the notes to also be checkboxes, so basically checkboxes within checkboxes and it can be nested up to 4 levels deep"

SPECIFIC CHANGES IMPLEMENTED THIS SESSION:
-----------------------------------------
1. ❌ REMOVED separate standard questions container
   → ✅ MOVED to bottom of discussion points as 3 integrated checkboxes

2. 🔧 FIXED +Sub button functionality 
   → Was broken due to ID-based lookup issues
   → Now correctly creates nested discussion points

3. 🎨 REDESIGNED nesting structure
   → FROM: Separate columns/containers for children
   → TO: Inline indented checkboxes (like bullet points but all checkboxes)
   → 4 visual levels with different colors and indentation

4. 📐 CONFIRMED layout: 2/3 discussion points, 1/3 action items side-by-side

5. ❌ REMOVED date selection from action items (user decision)

6. ❌ CONFIRMED meeting notes section deletion

7. 📎 ENHANCED transcript upload for better accessibility

USER PREFERENCES ESTABLISHED:
-----------------------------
- Wants structured checkbox hierarchy (not free-form notes)
- Standard questions should be integrated, not separate
- Action items should be simple (no dates)
- Meeting notes are unnecessary (discussion points capture everything)
- Prefers visual hierarchy through indentation and colors
- Values simplicity over feature complexity

KEY FILES MODIFIED THIS SESSION:
-------------------------------
- frontend/index.html: Removed standard questions section, updated meeting layout
- frontend/styles/main.css: Added nested checkbox styles (4 levels), side-by-side layout
- frontend/scripts/meeting-session.js: Complete rewrite of discussion points system
  * Added initializeDiscussionPointsWithStandardQuestions()
  * Fixed addSubDiscussionPoint() functionality
  * Implemented ID-based item management
  * Added visual hierarchy rendering

CURRENT WORKING STATE:
---------------------
✅ Server running on localhost:3000
✅ Meeting interface fully functional
✅ Nested checkboxes working (up to 4 levels)
✅ Standard questions auto-added to discussion points
✅ Action items simplified and working
✅ Transcript upload enhanced

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS IF CONTINUING:
----------------------------------
1. Test the meeting flow with Emily Johnson scenario
2. Add database persistence (currently in-memory)
3. Implement user authentication
4. Add meeting history and search
5. Email integration for meeting summaries

DEBUGGING NOTES:
---------------
- If +Sub button doesn't work: Check console for ID lookup errors
- If standard questions don't appear: Check initializeDiscussionPointsWithStandardQuestions()
- If nesting looks wrong: Review CSS classes .level-1 through .level-4
- Server restart may be needed after JavaScript changes

The project is in excellent shape for MVP Phase 1, with all core meeting management 
functionality working and a solid foundation for Phase 2 enhancements.
